// IP: internet protocol
// socket: a line across which info flows; where it flows when it goes from one computer to another
// TCP: transmission control protocol; the protocol for how the informtaion like HTTP, FTP is sent; 
//      take the info and split it into pieces and sed the pieces one at a time through the socket
//      from computer to computer
// packet: individual piece sent over TCP

import { request } from "http"

// we typicaly think of node as a web server, but it can also be used as an email or ftp server
// tcp is the same concept/idea as a stream. therefore node treats the packets as streams
// web sockets are kept pen constantly

// port: once a computer receives a packet, how it knows what program to send it to; "listening" to it
// ip address : port = socket address

// http: a set of rules (and format) for data being transferred on the web; hypertext transfer protocol
// MIME type: multipurpose internet mail extensions; a standard for specifying the type of data sent;
//       ex. application/json, text/html, image/jpeg; 


// http-parser
// the http-parser inside noe is joyant/http-parser

// with all of this, we have everything we need to create a server: connect to the internet, 
//       send a request, receive a response
